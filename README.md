# Assignment 2

For this site I mainly focused on cleaning up the css and kept the majority of the layout choices made in the original design. I did significantly modify the header and figure layouts, yet the flow of the page was otherwise left intact.

- Changed the heading embellishments to feature colored gradients
- Added the contrasting color gradient to the header
- Added figure styling to better flow with layout
- Cleaned up the styles of the masonry style grid layout
- Squared off the corners of the citations
- Changed fonts for headers
