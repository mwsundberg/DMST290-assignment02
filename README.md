# Assignment 2

For this site I mainly focused on cleaning up the css and kept the majority of the layout choices made in the original design. I did significantly modify the header and figure layouts, yet the flow of the page was otherwise left intact.

- Changed the heading embellishments to feature colored gradients
- Added the contrasting color gradient to the header
- Added figure styling to better flow with layout
- Cleaned up the styles of the masonry style grid layout
- Squared off the corners of the citations
- Changed fonts for headers and body text
- Adjusted line spacing

I changed the visual styling on the headings and header to add a visual hierarchy, as indicated by the width of the bar next to the heading, in order to improve navigability. The colored element added to the header was to draw the eye, bringing attention to the title and starting the viewer on a good flow for viewing the page. The masonry styling change was done in order to reduce the distraction from the drop-shadows, instead providing cleaner distinctions. The header fonts were changed to a cutesy sans-serif to stand out against the serif picked for body text (since serifs are generally more legible for walls of text). Line spacing changes improved readability as well.
